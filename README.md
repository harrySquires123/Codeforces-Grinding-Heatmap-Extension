## 🧠 What This Is

This Chrome extension adds a **contribution-style heatmap** to any Codeforces user profile.  
But unlike the official one, this one reflects **how many problems** you solved each day — not just your contest rating or participation.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Color = Problem Count**  
  The more problems you solve on a given day, the **darker** the heatmap square.

- 🖱️ **Hover to Reveal**  
  Hover over any square to see:
  - 🧠 Problem name  
  - ⭐ Rating (if available)  
  - 🔗 Direct link to the problem  
  - ⚠️ Gray links indicate duplicates (already solved before)

- 📅 **Multiple Years Supported**  
  Explore your activity all the way back to your **first AC** on Codeforces.
